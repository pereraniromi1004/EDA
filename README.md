Explanatory Data Analysis
The method is named for its use of the Bonferroni inequalities.[1] An extension of the method to confidence intervals was proposed by Olive Jean Dunn.[2]

Statistical hypothesis testing is based on rejecting the null hypothesis if the likelihood of the observed data under the null hypotheses is low. 
If multiple hypotheses are tested, the chance of observing a rare event increases, and therefore, the likelihood of incorrectly rejecting a null 
hypothesis (i.e., making a Type I error) increases.[3]

The Bonferroni correction compensates for that increase by testing each individual hypothesis at a significance level of 
{\displaystyle \alpha /m}\alpha /m, where {\displaystyle \alpha }\alpha  is the desired overall alpha level and {\displaystyle m}m is 
the number of hypotheses.[4] For example, if a trial is testing {\displaystyle m=20}m=20 hypotheses with a desired {\displaystyle \alpha =0.05}\alpha = 0.05,
then the Bonferroni correction would test each individual hypothesis at {\displaystyle \alpha =0.05/20=0.0025}{\displaystyle
\alpha =0.05/20=0.0025}. Likewise, when constructing multiple confidence intervals the same phenomenon appears.
